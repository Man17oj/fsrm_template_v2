Your markdown has a couple of typos in the template variable names. The correct Jinja2 syntax for cookiecutter variables is `<Place Holder>`. In your markdown, you have:

```
# 💳 Project: <Project Name>
<Place Holder>
```

These should be:

```
# 💳 Project: <Project Name>
<Place Holder>
```

Everywhere else, you use <Project Name> correctly.

**Summary:**  
- Use <Project Name> and <Project Name> 
- The rest of your markdown is syntactically correct for cookiecutter template variables.

**Corrected snippet:**
```markdown
# 💳 Project: <Project Name>
<Project Name>
```

       Defines the template variables for project generation.
- **.gitignore**:  
       Prevents sensitive or unnecessary files from being tracked by git.
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**:  
       Automates code formatting and linting before commits.
- **Dockerfile**:  
       Enables containerized development and deployment.
- **Makefile**:  
       Simplifies common tasks (setup, linting, testing) with `make` commands.
- **pyproject.toml**:  
       Centralizes configuration for Python tools and dependencies.
- **README.md**:  
       Provides project overview, setup, and usage instructions.
- **requirements.txt**:  
       Lists Python packages required for the project.
- **setup.py**:  
       Allows the project to be installed as a package.
- **.github/**:  
       Contains GitHub-specific templates and CI/CD workflows.
- **config/**:  
       Stores configuration files for experiments or environments.
- **data/**:

### 5️⃣ Running Tests 🧪

     Tests are located in the [`tests/`](tests/) directory and use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/):

     ```bash
     pytest
     ```

### 6️⃣ Using Docker (Optional) 🐳

     A [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided for containerized development:

     ```bash
     docker build -t my-credit-risk-model .
     docker run -it my-credit-risk-model
     ```
