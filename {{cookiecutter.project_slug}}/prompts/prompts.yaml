step_1:
  step_name: "Data Exploration"
  human_guidance: |
    Please explore the dataset by performing the following operations:

    1. Load the dataset and display the first 5 rows.
    2. Provide a summary of the dataset including:
        - Number of rows and columns
        - Data types of each column
        - Basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical columns
        - Frequency counts for categorical columns
    3. Identify and list any missing values in the dataset.
    4. Visualize the distribution of numerical features using histograms.
    5. Create bar plots for categorical features to show their distributions.
    6. Identify any potential outliers in numerical columns using box plots.
    7. Provide insights on correlations between numerical features using a correlation matrix.


step_2:
  step_name: "Data Cleaning"
  human_guidance: |
    Please clean the dataset by performing the following operations:

    1. Remove any duplicate rows if they exist.
    2. Handle missing values:
        - For numerical columns, fill missing values with the column mean.
        - For categorical columns, fill missing values with the most frequent category.
    3. Standardize column names: convert them to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.
    4. Drop any columns that have more than 80% missing values.
    5. Ensure all date columns are converted to proper datetime format.
    6. For Numerical columns, replace any outliers in numerical columns using the interquartile range (IQR) method.
    7. Using onehot encoding, convert categorical variables into numerical format. After than remove all categorical variables columns.
    8. Undertake any data cleaning steps that you deem necessary to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis and machine learning algorithm.
